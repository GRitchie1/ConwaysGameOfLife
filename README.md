# ConwaysGameOfLife with Images

Takes an input image, converts it to a black and white image, interprets this as an array of either 1 or 0.
This array is then used as the input grid for Conways game of life or similar "evolution" algorithms.

The output image is saved after 100 iterations of the algorithm and the Black and white image is also output for testing purposes.

Main.py is the main program.  It imports classes from Image and Grid which are used to handle the image conversion and the Conways game of life stuff respectively.

I will add more detail to this readme the next time I get a chance to work on this project.
